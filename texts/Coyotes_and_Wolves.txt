Coyotes and wolves are both types of wild canines native to the United States. They are related. In some parts of the country, they have mixed to create a sub species called coywolf. While coyotes and wolves are similar animals, they are also different in many ways. While wolves once inhabited much of North America, they are now limited to wilderness areas. In the meantime, coyotes have spread from the western half of the country to the Southeast and Northeast. 
Unlike wolves, they do well living around humans and can even be found in cities. On average, wolves are much larger than coyotes. Coyotes have sharper ears and noses, while wolves have more rounded ears and bigger noses. While coyotes' fur tends to be gray or brown, wolves can be grey, white, red, or black. Coyotes can run faster and longer than wolves. Both wolves and coyotes live in family units that include a mother, a father, and puppies. Coyote packs may expand temporarily to include unrelated adult and young coyotes for hunting, but wolf packs usually contain many families. Wolves hunt in packs to kill very large prey like bears or elk. Coyotes hunt in pairs and eat smaller prey such as rabbits, mice, and reptiles, though they may sometimes cooperate with other adults to kill larger mammals. 
Unlike wolves, coyotes will also eat fruits and vegetables. Coyotes and wolves are both important in Native American stories. Wolves usually symbolize strength and loyalty. Often, coyotes play the part of a trickster or one who breaks the rules in clever ways. Wolves and coyotes are similar animals, but subtle differences in behavior and living conditions make them different species.
