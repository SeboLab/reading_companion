# reading-anxiety-app
Android application used for running experiments for the reading anxiety project. Built on top of Professor Sebo's previous [project](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/ScazLab/nao_tutoring_behavior_tablet_app_with_gradle/tree/master/app/src/main/java/tutoringproject/behaviors__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!8aSG6-rV0Ki7fs5MWxfBaeo-jcCNMZCXy4dUa3Y7b2dgeoIvy3j0SR83JVKov4L15qfxa21Hczku24wZL12YmUWJHS11VtA$) that used a TCP/IP app as well.

Code should contain all the documentation and comments to understand it.
